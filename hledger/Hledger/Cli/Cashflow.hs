The @cashflow@ command prints a simplified cashflow statement.  It just
shows the change in all "cash" accounts for the period (without the
traditional segmentation into operating, investing, and financing
cash flows.)

This command displays a simple cashflow statement, showing changes
in "cash" accounts. It assumes that these accounts are under a top-level 
`asset` account (case insensitive, plural forms also allowed) and do not 
contain `receivable` or `A/R` in their name.
