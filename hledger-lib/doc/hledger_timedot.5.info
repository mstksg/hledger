hledger_timedot(5) hledger dev
******************************

Timedot is a plain text format for logging dated, categorised quantities
(eg time), supported by hledger.  It is convenient for approximate and
retroactive time logging, eg when the real-time clock-in/out required
with a timeclock file is too precise or too interruptive.  It can be
formatted like a bar chart, making clear at a glance where time was
spent.

   Though called "timedot", the format does not specify the commodity
being logged, so could represent other dated, quantifiable things.  Eg
you could record a single-entry journal of financial transactions,
perhaps slightly more conveniently than with hledger_journal(5) format.

*************

A timedot file contains a series of day entries.  A day entry begins
with a date, and is followed by category/quantity pairs, one per line.
Dates are hledger-style simple dates (see hledger_journal(5)).
Categories are hledger-style account names, optionally indented.  There
must be at least two spaces between the category and the quantity.
Quantities can be written in two ways:

  1. a series of dots (period characters).  Each dot represents "a
     quarter" - eg, a quarter hour.  Spaces can be used to group dots
     into hours, for easier counting.

  2. a number (integer or decimal), representing "units" - eg, hours.  A
     good alternative when dots are cumbersome.  (A number also can
     record negative quantities.)

   Blank lines and lines beginning with #, ; or * are ignored.  An
example:

# on this day, 6h was spent on client work, 1.5h on haskell FOSS work, etc.

   Or with numbers:

   I prefer to use period for separating account components.  We can
make this work with an account alias:

2016/2/4
fos.hledger.timedot  4
fos.ledger           ..

$ hledger -f t.timedot --alias /\\./=: bal date:2016/2/4
                4.50  fos
                4.00    hledger:timedot
                0.50    ledger
--------------------
                4.50

   Here is a sample.timedot.
